# Data Visualisation - Exploration

Now that you've demonstrated your software is setup, and you have the basics of data manipulation, the goal of this assignment is to practice transforming, visualising, and exploring data.

# Mass shootings in the US

In July 2012, in the aftermath of a mass shooting in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, [Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map/) published a report on mass shootings in the United States since 1982. Importantly, they provided the underlying data set as [an open-source database](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/) for anyone interested in studying and understanding this criminal behavior.

## Obtain the data

### Specific questions

-   Generate a data frame that summarizes the number of mass shootings per year.

```{r}
# Load the required library
library(tidyverse)

# Summarize the number of mass shootings per year
summary_df <- mass_shootings %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

# Display the result
print(summary_df)
```

-   Generate a bar chart that identifies the number of mass shooters associated with each race category. The bars should be sorted from highest to lowest and each bar should show its number.

```{r}
# Create a bar chart of mass shooters by race category
chart <- mass_shootings %>%
  group_by(race) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(race, count), y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(x = "Race", y = "Number of Mass Shooters") +
  ggtitle("Number of Mass Shooters by Race") +
  theme_minimal()

# Display the chart
print(chart)
```

-   Generate a boxplot visualizing the number of total victims, by type of location.

```{r}

# Create a boxplot of total victims by location type
boxplot <- mass_shootings %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = location_type, y = total_victims)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(x = "Location Type", y = "Total Victims") +
  ggtitle("Number of Total Victims by Location Type") +
  theme_minimal()

# Display the boxplot
print(boxplot)
```

-   Redraw the same plot, but remove the Las Vegas Strip massacre from the dataset.

```{r}
# Remove the Las Vegas Strip massacre from the dataset
data_filtered_withoutvegas <- mass_shootings %>% filter(!grepl("Las Vegas Strip", location))

# Create a boxplot of total victims by location type (excluding Las Vegas Strip massacre)
boxplot_filtered <- data_filtered_withoutvegas %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = location_type, y = total_victims)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(x = "Location Type", y = "Total Victims") +
  ggtitle("Number of Total Victims by Location Type (excluding Las Vegas Strip)") +
  theme_minimal()

# Display the boxplot
print(boxplot_filtered)
```

### More open-ended questions

Address the following questions. Generate appropriate figures/tables to support your conclusions.

-   How many white males with prior signs of mental illness initiated a mass shooting after 2000?

-   To answer the question, we can use the provided dataset to filter and count the number of white males with prior signs of mental illness who initiated a mass shooting after 2000. 

```{r}
# Filter the data for incidents after 2000 and white males with prior signs of mental illness
filtered_data_openq1 <- mass_shootings %>%
  filter(year > 2000, race == "White", male == TRUE, prior_mental_illness == "Yes")

# Count the number of incidents
incident_count_openq1 <- nrow(filtered_data_openq1)

# Print the result
incident_count_openq1

# Count the number of incidents per year
incident_counts_openq1_2 <- filtered_data_openq1 %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(incident_count = n(), .groups = 'drop')

# Create a bar graph to visualize the number of incidents per year
chart_openq1 <- ggplot(incident_counts_openq1_2, aes(x = factor(year), y = incident_count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Number of Incidents", title = "Number of Incidents with Prior Mental Illness (White Race, after 2000)") +
  theme_minimal()

# Display the chart
print(chart_openq1)


```

-   Which month of the year has the most mass shootings? Generate a bar chart sorted in chronological (natural) order (Jan-Feb-Mar- etc) to provide evidence of your answer.

```{r}

# Count the number of mass shootings per month
monthly_counts <- mass_shootings %>%
  count(month, sort = FALSE)

# Sort the months in chronological order
monthly_counts$month <- factor(monthly_counts$month, levels = month.abb)

# Create a bar chart to visualize the number of mass shootings per month
chart_monthly_counts <- ggplot(monthly_counts, aes(x = month, y = n, fill = month)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), vjust = -0.5, size = 3) +  # Add data labels
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Number of Mass Shootings", title = "Number of Mass Shootings per Month") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Month")

# Print the chart
print(chart_monthly_counts)
```

-   How does the distribution of mass shooting fatalities differ between White and Black shooters? What about White and Latino shooters?

-   Answer
    Based on the analysis conducted as below, it can be observed that:
    -   The median number of fatalities for Black shooters is lower (5) compared to White shooters (6).
    -   The range of fatalities for Black shooters (3 to 12) is narrower than that of White shooters (3 to 58).
    -   White shooters have a higher maximum number of fatalities compared to Black shooters.
    -   The median number of fatalities for Latino shooters (5) is lower than that for White shooters (6).
    -   The range of fatalities for Latino shooters (3 to 7) is narrower compared to that of White shooters (3 to 58).
    -   White shooters have a higher maximum number of fatalities compared to Latino shooters.
    Overall, the analysis suggests that the distribution of mass shooting fatalities differs between different racial groups. White shooters tend to have a wider range and higher maximum number of fatalities compared to both Black and Latino shooters. 
    However, further analysis and context are necessary to fully understand the underlying factors contributing to these differences.
    
```{r}

# Filter the data for White and Black shooters
filtered_data_white_black <- mass_shootings %>%
  filter(race %in% c("White", "Black"))

# Filter the data for White and Latino shooters
filtered_data_white_latino <- mass_shootings %>%
  filter(race %in% c("White", "Latino"))

# Create boxplots to compare the distribution of fatalities
chart_white_black <- ggplot(filtered_data_white_black, aes(x = race, y = fatalities, fill = race)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Shooter Race", y = "Number of Fatalities", title = "Distribution of Mass Shooting Fatalities (White vs Black)") +
  theme_minimal()

chart_white_latino <- ggplot(filtered_data_white_latino, aes(x = race, y = fatalities, fill = race)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Shooter Race", y = "Number of Fatalities", title = "Distribution of Mass Shooting Fatalities (White vs Latino)") +

    min = min(fatalities),
    q1 = quantile(fatalities, 0.25),
    median = median(fatalities),
    q3 = quantile(fatalities, 0.75),
    max = max(fatalities)
  )

# Calculate the statistics for White and Latino shooters
stats_white_latino <- filtered_data_white_latino %>%
  group_by(race) %>%
  summarise(
    min = min(fatalities),
    q1 = quantile(fatalities, 0.25),
    median = median(fatalities),
    q3 = quantile(fatalities, 0.75),
    max = max(fatalities)
  )

# Display the statistics in a table
pander::pander(stats_white_black, caption = "Statistics for Distribution of Fatalities (White vs Black)")
pander::pander(stats_white_latino, caption = "Statistics for Distribution of Fatalities (White vs Latino)")

```

### Very open-ended

-   Are mass shootings with shooters suffering from mental illness different from mass shootings with no signs of mental illness in the shooter?

-   Answer:
    The median number of fatalities for mass shootings with shooters suffering from mental illness is 6.5, while the median for mass shootings with no signs of mental illness is 6.0. This suggests that there is a slight difference in the number of fatalities between the two groups, with shooters suffering from mental illness having a slightly higher median number of fatalities.

However, it's important to note that the range of fatalities is larger for mass shootings with shooters suffering from mental illness (3 to 32) compared to those with no signs of mental illness (4 to 24). This indicates that there is more variability in the number of fatalities for mass shootings with shooters suffering from mental illness.

Overall, while there is a slight difference in the median number of fatalities, it's essential to consider other factors and conduct further analysis to determine if mass shootings with shooters suffering from mental illness are significantly different from those with no signs of mental illness.

```{r}
# Filter the data for mass shootings with shooters suffering from mental illness
filtered_data_mental_illness <- mass_shootings %>%
  filter(prior_mental_illness %in% c("Yes", "Unknown"))

# Filter the data for mass shootings with no signs of mental illness in the shooter
filtered_data_no_mental_illness <- mass_shootings %>%
  filter(prior_mental_illness == "No")
# Combine filtered data for mental illness and no mental illness
combined_data <- rbind(
  mutate(filtered_data_mental_illness, category = "Mental Illness"),
  mutate(filtered_data_no_mental_illness, category = "No Mental Illness")
)

# Create a boxplot with grouped data
chart_combined <- ggplot(combined_data, aes(x = category, y = fatalities, fill = category)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Prior Mental Illness", y = "Number of Fatalities", title = "Distribution of Mass Shooting Fatalities") +
  theme_minimal()

# Display the combined boxplot
print(chart_combined)

# Calculate key statistical measures for each category
summary_table <- combined_data %>%
  group_by(category) %>%
  summarise(
    min = min(fatalities),
    q1 = quantile(fatalities, 0.25),
    median = median(fatalities),
    q3 = quantile(fatalities, 0.75),
    max = max(fatalities),
    .groups = 'drop'
  )

# Display the summary table
print(summary_table)

```

-   Assess the relationship between mental illness and total victims, mental illness and location type, and the intersection of all three variables.

```{r}
# Relationship between mental illness and total victims
total_victims_summary <- mass_shootings %>%
  group_by(prior_mental_illness) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_total_victims = mean(total_victims),
    median_total_victims = median(total_victims),
    min_total_victims = min(total_victims),
    max_total_victims = max(total_victims),
    .groups = 'drop'
  )

# Create a bar graph to visualize the relationship between mental illness and total victims
chart_total_victims <- ggplot(mass_shootings, aes(x = prior_mental_illness, y = total_victims, fill = prior_mental_illness)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "Prior Mental Illness", y = "Total Victims", title = "Relationship between Mental Illness and Total Victims") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Prior Mental Illness")

# Relationship between mental illness and location type
location_type_counts <- mass_shootings %>%
  group_by(prior_mental_illness, location_type) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop')

# Create a stacked bar graph to visualize the relationship between mental illness and location type
chart_location_type <- ggplot(location_type_counts, aes(x = prior_mental_illness, y = count, fill = location_type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "Prior Mental Illness", y = "Count", title = "Relationship between Mental Illness and Location Type") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Location Type") +
  geom_text(aes(label = count), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), color = "white", size = 3)

# Intersection of mental illness, total victims, and location type
intersection_counts <- mass_shootings %>%
  group_by(prior_mental_illness, location_type) %>%
  summarise(total_victims = sum(total_victims), .groups = 'drop')

# Create a table to display the intersection of mental illness, total victims, and location type
intersection_table <- intersection_counts %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = prior_mental_illness, values_from = total_victims, names_prefix = "Total Victims: ") %>%
  rename(Location_Type = location_type)

# Print the figures and table

Make sure to provide a couple of sentences of written interpretation of your tables/figures. Graphs and tables alone will not be sufficient to answer this question.

# Exploring credit card fraud

We will be using a dataset with credit card transactions containing legitimate and fraud transactions. Fraud is typically well below 1% of all transactions, so a naive model that predicts that all transactions are legitimate and not fraudulent would have an accuracy of well over 99%-- pretty good, no? (well, not quite as we will see later in the course)

You can read more on credit card fraud on [Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Weighted Support Vector Machine](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=105944)

The dataset we will use consists of credit card transactions and it includes information about each transaction including customer details, the merchant and category of purchase, and whether or not the transaction was a fraud.

## Obtain the data

The dataset is too large to be hosted on Canvas or Github, so please download it from dropbox https://www.dropbox.com/sh/q1yk8mmnbbrzavl/AAAxzRtIhag9Nc_hODafGV2ka?dl=0 and save it in your `dsb` repo, under the `data` folder

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

card_fraud <- read_csv(here::here("data", "card_fraud.csv"))

glimpse(card_fraud)
```

The data dictionary is as follows

| trans_year            | Transaction year                            |
| category              | category of merchant                        |
| amt                   | amount of transaction                       |
| city                  | City of card holder                         |

| dob                   | date of birth of card holder                |
| merch_lat             | Latitude Location of Merchant               |
| merch_long            | Longitude Location of Merchant              |
| is_fraud              | Whether Transaction is Fraud (1) or Not (0) |

-   In this dataset, how likely are fraudulent transactions? Generate a table that summarizes the number and frequency of fraudulent transactions per year.

```{r}

```

-   How much money (in US\$ terms) are fraudulent transactions costing the company? Generate a table that summarizes the total amount of legitimate and fraudulent transactions per year and calculate the % of fraudulent transactions, in US\$ terms.

```{r}

```

-   Generate a histogram that shows the distribution of amounts charged to credit card, both for legitimate and fraudulent accounts. Also, for both types of transactions, calculate some quick summary statistics.

```{r}

```

-   What types of purchases are most likely to be instances of fraud? Consider category of merchants and produce a bar chart that shows % of total fraudulent transactions sorted in order.

```{r}

```

-   When is fraud more prevalent? Which days, months, hours? To create new variables to help you in your analysis, we use the `lubridate` package and the following code

```         
mutate(
  date_only = lubridate::date(trans_date_trans_time),
  month_name = lubridate::month(trans_date_trans_time, label=TRUE),
  hour = lubridate::hour(trans_date_trans_time),
  weekday = lubridate::wday(trans_date_trans_time, label = TRUE)
  )
```

-   Are older customers significantly more likely to be victims of credit card fraud? To calculate a customer's age, we use the `lubridate` package and the following code

```         
  mutate(
   age = interval(dob, trans_date_trans_time) / years(1),
    )
```

```{r}

```

-   Is fraud related to distance? The distance between a card holder's home and the location of the transaction can be a feature that is related to fraud. To calculate distance, we need the latidue/longitude of card holders's home and the latitude/longitude of the transaction, and we will use the [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) to calculate distance. I adapted code to [calculate distance between two points on earth](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-distance-two-points-earth/amp/) which you can find below

```{r}
# distance between card holder's home and transaction
# code adapted from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-distance-two-points-earth/amp/


card_fraud <- card_fraud %>%
  mutate(
    
    # convert latitude/longitude to radians
    lat1_radians = lat / 57.29577951,
    lat2_radians = merch_lat / 57.29577951,
    long1_radians = long / 57.29577951,
    long2_radians = merch_long / 57.29577951,
    
    # calculate distance in miles
    distance_miles = 3963.0 * acos((sin(lat1_radians) * sin(lat2_radians)) + cos(lat1_radians) * cos(lat2_radians) * cos(long2_radians - long1_radians)),

    # calculate distance in km
    distance_km = 6377.830272 * acos((sin(lat1_radians) * sin(lat2_radians)) + cos(lat1_radians) * cos(lat2_radians) * cos(long2_radians - long1_radians))

  )

```

Plot a boxplot or a violin plot that looks at the relationship of distance and `is_fraud`. Does distance seem to be a useful feature in explaining fraud?

# Exploring sources of electricity production, CO2 emissions, and GDP per capita.

There are many sources of data on how countries generate their electricity and their CO2 emissions. I would like you to create three graphs:

## 1. A stacked area chart that shows how your own country generated its electricity since 2000.

You will use

`geom_area(colour="grey90", alpha = 0.5, position = "fill")`

## 2. A scatter plot that looks at how CO2 per capita and GDP per capita are related

## 3. A scatter plot that looks at how electricity usage (kWh) per capita/day GDP per capita are related

We will get energy data from the Our World in Data website, and CO2 and GDP per capita emissions from the World Bank, using the `wbstats`package.

Specific questions:

1.  How would you turn `energy` to long, tidy format?
2.  You may need to join these data frames
    -   Use `left_join` from `dplyr` to [join the tables](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html)
    -   To complete the merge, you need a unique *key* to match observations between the data frames. Country names may not be consistent among the three dataframes, so please use the 3-digit ISO code for each country
    -   An aside: There is a great package called [`countrycode`](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/countrycode) that helps solve the problem of inconsistent country names (Is it UK? United Kingdom? Great Britain?). `countrycode()` takes as an input a country's name in a specific format and outputs it using whatever format you specify.
3.  Write a function that takes as input any country's name and returns all three graphs. You can use the `patchwork` package to arrange the three graphs as shown below



```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "electricity-co2-gdp.png"), error = FALSE)
```


# Deliverables

There is a lot of explanatory text, comments, etc. You do not need these, so delete them and produce a stand-alone document that you could share with someone. Knit the edited and completed R Markdown (qmd) file as a Word or HTML document (use the "Knit" button at the top of the script editor window) and upload it to Canvas. You must be comitting and pushing your changes to your own Github repo as you go along.

# Rubric

13/13: Problem set is 100% completed. Every question was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output. Multiple Github commits. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often.

8/13: Problem set is 60--80% complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance. Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). A few Github commits.

5/13: Problem set is less than 60% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often. Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. No Github commits.
