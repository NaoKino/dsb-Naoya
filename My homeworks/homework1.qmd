# Data Manipulation

## Problem 1: Use logical operators to find flights that:

```         
-   Q1: Had an arrival delay of two or more hours (\> 120 minutes)
    Q1: Answer:  10,034 Flights

-   Q2: Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
    Q2: Answer:  7,198 Flights

-   Q3: Were operated by United (`UA`), American (`AA`), or Delta (`DL`)
    Q3: Answer:  13,954 Flights

-   Q4: Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
    Q4: Answer:  86,326 Flights

-   Q5: Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late
    Q5: Answer:  29 Flights
    
-   Q6: Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
    Q6: Answer:  1,948 Flights
```

```{r}
# Q1: The flights delayed more than 120 minutes
q1_flights <- flights %>%
  filter(arr_delay > 120)

# Q2: The flights whihch destination are Huston
q2_flights <- flights %>%
  filter(dest %in% c("IAH", "HOU"))

# Q3: Were operated
q3_flights <- flights %>%
  filter(carrier %in% c("UA", "AA", "DL"))

# Q4: The flights depearted in July, August, September
q4_flights <- flights %>%
  filter(month %in% c(7, 8, 9))

# Q5: Arrived more than two hours late, but didn’t leave late Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
q5_flights <- flights %>%
  filter(arr_delay > 120,
         dep_delay <= 0)

# Q6: Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
q6_flights <- flights %>%
  filter(dep_delay >= 60,
         (arr_delay - dep_delay) > 30)

# showing answer to each question
answer <- data.frame(
  Q1 = nrow(q1_flights),
  Q2 = nrow(q2_flights),
  Q3 = nrow(q3_flights),
  Q4 = nrow(q4_flights),
  Q5 = nrow(q5_flights),
  Q6 = nrow(q6_flights)
)

print(answer)

```

## Problem 2: What months had the highest and lowest proportion of cancelled flights? Interpret any seasonal patterns. To determine if a flight was cancelled use the following code

Answer : When organizing the data and examining the bar graph, it was found that the month with the highest percentage of canceled flights was February, at 5.371%. Conversely, the month with the lowest percentage of canceled flights was October, at 0.938%.

```         
flights %>% 
  filter(is.na(dep_time)) 
```

```{r}
#| label: problem-2

# calculating the proportion of flights that cancelled
cancelled_proportion <- flights %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(cancelled_proportion = sum(is.na(dep_delay) | is.na(arr_delay)) / n())

# Making bar graph
ggplot(cancelled_proportion, aes(x = month, y = cancelled_proportion)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "transparent", color = "blue") +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(cancelled_proportion)), vjust = -0.5, color = "blue") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12, labels = month.abb) +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Cancelled Flights Proportion") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Problem 3: What plane (specified by the `tailnum` variable) traveled the most times from New York City airports in 2013? Please `left_join()` the resulting table with the table `planes` (also included in the `nycflights13` package).

For the plane with the greatest number of flights and that had more than 50 seats, please create a table where it flew to during 2013.

Answer: Based on the table as shown below, N725MQ is the plane which flew most during 2013 and the number of the flights is 575.

```{r}
# Filter the flights dataset for the year 2013
flights_2013 <- flights[flights$year == 2013, ]

# Left join the flights dataset with the planes dataset
merged_table <- dplyr::left_join(flights_2013, planes, by = "tailnum")

# Count the number of flights for each plane
flight_counts <- merged_table %>% dplyr::count(tailnum, sort = TRUE)

# Set options to display more columns in the table
options(width = 100)

# Set options to display all digits for numeric columns
options(digits = 22)

# Identify the top 10 planes with the highest number of flights
top_10_planes <- head(flight_counts, 10)

# Display the top 10 planes in a table
top_10_planes

kable(top_10_planes)

# Create a bar graph of flight counts for each plane
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = flight_counts, aes(x = tailnum, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue", alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Tail Number", y = "Flight Count", title = "Flight Counts by Plane") +
  theme_bw()

```

## Problem 4: The `nycflights13` package includes a table (`weather`) that describes the weather during 2013. Use that table to answer the following questions:

```         
-   Q1: What is the distribution of temperature (`temp`) in July 2013? Identify any important outliers in terms of the `wind_speed` variable.
    Q1: Answer: It seems that two data which exceeds wind speed as of 22.5 are the outliers in terms of the 'wind_speed' variable.
    
-   Q2: What is the relationship between `dewp` and `humid`?
    Q2: Answer: Correration coefficient between dewp and humid is 51.2%. And as shown in the graph, it seems slightly positive relationship between dewp and humid.

-   What is the relationship between `precip` and `visib`?
    Q3: Answer: Correration coefficient between precip and visib is -32.0%. And as shown in the graph, it seems slightly negative relationship between dewp and humid.
```

```{r}
# Get the weather dataset
weather <- nycflights13::weather

# Extract data for July 2013
july_2013_weather <- subset(weather, month == 7 & year == 2013)

# Visualize the distribution of `temp` and its relationship with `wind_speed`
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(july_2013_weather, aes(x = temp, y = wind_speed)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Temperature", y = "Wind Speed") +
  theme_bw()

# Create a table to display correlation coefficients
cor_table <- matrix(NA, nrow = 2, ncol = 2,
                    dimnames = list(c("Dew Point", "Precipitation"),
                                    c("Humidity", "Visibility")))

# Calculate correlation coefficients
cor_table[1, 2] <- cor(weather$dewp, weather$humid)
cor_table[2, 2] <- cor(weather$precip, weather$visib)

# Display the correlation coefficients table
cor_table

# Create scatter plots for dewp vs. humid and precip vs. visib
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

# Scatter plot for dewp vs. humid
plot(weather$dewp, weather$humid, xlab = "Dew Point", ylab = "Humidity",
     main = "Dew Point vs. Humidity")

# Scatter plot for precip vs. visib
plot(weather$precip, weather$visib, xlab = "Precipitation", ylab = "Visibility",
     main = "Precipitation vs. Visibility")

# Reset the plotting layout
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))

# Calculate correlation and additional statistics for dewp vs. humid
cor_dewp_humid <- cor.test(weather$dewp, weather$humid)
cor_dewp_humid_table <- data.frame(
  Variable1 = "Dew Point",
  Variable2 = "Humidity",
  Correlation = cor_dewp_humid$estimate,
  P_Value = cor_dewp_humid$p.value,
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# Calculate correlation and additional statistics for precip vs. visib
cor_precip_visib <- cor.test(weather$precip, weather$visib)
cor_precip_visib_table <- data.frame(
  Variable1 = "Precipitation",
  Variable2 = "Visibility",
  Correlation = cor_precip_visib$estimate,
  P_Value = cor_precip_visib$p.value,
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# Display the correlation tables
kable(cor_dewp_humid_table)
kable(cor_precip_visib_table)
```

## Problem 5: Use the `flights` and `planes` tables to answer the following questions:

```         
-   Q1: How many planes have a missing date of manufacture?
    Q1: Answer: There are 70 planes which has missing date of manufacture.

-   Q2: What are the five most common manufacturers?
    Q2: Answer: As shown in the table below, Boeing, Airbus Industrie, Bombardier Inc, Airbus, and Embraer are the five most common manufactures. 

-   Q3: Has the distribution of manufacturer changed over time as reflected by the airplanes flying from NYC in 2013? (Hint: you may need to use case_when() to recode the manufacturer name and collapse rare vendors into a category called Other.)
    Q3: As shown in the graph, Production volume is high from March through August and relatively low in the other months. February has the lowest airplane production volume due to the shorter number of days than the other months.
```

```{r}
# Load the flights and planes tables
flights <- nycflights13::flights
planes <- nycflights13::planes

# Count the number of planes with missing date of manufacture
missing_manufacture <- sum(is.na(planes$year))

# Identify the five most common manufacturers
top_manufacturers <- head(sort(table(planes$manufacturer), decreasing = TRUE), 5)

# Create a data frame for flights from NYC in 2013
flights_2013_NYC <- flights[flights$year == 2013 & flights$origin %in% c("JFK", "LGA", "EWR"), ]
flights_2013_NYC <- merge(flights_2013_NYC, planes, by = "tailnum")

# Recode manufacturer and collapse rare vendors into "Other" category
library(dplyr)
flights_2013_NYC <- flights_2013_NYC %>%
  mutate(manufacturer = case_when(
    manufacturer %in% top_manufacturers ~ as.character(manufacturer),
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  ))

# Checking lenght of flights_2013_NYC$year and flights_2013_NYC$manufacturer
nrow(flights_2013_NYC)
length(flights_2013_NYC$year)
length(flights_2013_NYC$manufacturer)

# Display the results
missing_manufacture
top_manufacturers

# Display the results using kable
kable(data.frame(missing_manufacture), caption = "Planes with Missing Date of Manufacture")
kable(data.frame(top_manufacturers), caption = "Top 5 Manufacturers")

# Filter flights from NYC in 2013 and merge with planes table
flights_2013_NYC <- flights %>%
  filter(year == 2013, origin %in% c("JFK", "LGA", "EWR")) %>%
  left_join(planes, by = "tailnum")

# Recode manufacturer and collapse rare vendors into "Other" category
flights_2013_NYC <- flights_2013_NYC %>%
  mutate(manufacturer = case_when(
    manufacturer %in% c("BOEING", "AIRBUS") ~ as.character(manufacturer),
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  ))

# Calculate the manufacturer distribution by year
manufacturer_distribution <- flights_2013_NYC %>%
  group_by(month, manufacturer) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  ungroup()

# Pivot the data to create a table format
manufacturer_table <- manufacturer_distribution %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = manufacturer, values_from = count, values_fill = 0)

# Display the manufacturer distribution over time
kable(manufacturer_table)

# Aggregate the data by month and manufacturer
manufacturer_monthly <- flights_2013_NYC %>%
  group_by(month, manufacturer) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  ungroup()

# Filter the top 5 manufacturers based on total aircraft count
top_5_manufacturers <- manufacturer_monthly %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(total_count = sum(count)) %>%
  top_n(5, total_count) %>%
  select(manufacturer)

# Merge with the aggregated data
top_manufacturer_monthly <- manufacturer_monthly %>%
  filter(manufacturer %in% top_5_manufacturers$manufacturer)

# Create a line graph
ggplot(top_manufacturer_monthly, aes(x = month, y = count, group = manufacturer, color = manufacturer)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Number of Aircraft", title = "Manufacturer Distribution over Time") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12, labels = month.abb) +
  theme_minimal()

```

## Problem 6: Use the `flights` and `planes` tables to answer the following questions:

```         
-   Q1: What is the oldest plane (specified by the tailnum variable) that flew from New York City airports in 2013?
    Q1: Answer: Oldest plane is N381AA, which manufactured in 1956.

-   Q2:How many airplanes that flew from New York City are included in the planes table?
    Q2: Answer: There are 336776 airplanes that flew from New York.
```

```{r}

# Create the 'flights_planes' object by merging the 'flights' and 'planes' tables
flights_planes <- merge(flights, planes, by.x = "tailnum", by.y = "tailnum")

# Count the number of airplanes from NYC included in the planes table
num_airplanes_01 <- flights_planes %>%
  arrange(year.y) %>%
  group_by(year.y) %>%
  count() %>%
  top_n(15)

# Print the result
kable(num_airplanes_01, format = "markdown")

# Filter airplanes with year.y equal to 1956
num_airplanes <- flights_planes %>%
  filter(year.y == 1956) %>%
  count(tailnum)

# Print the result
kable(num_airplanes, format = "markdown")


# Count the number of airplanes that flew from New York City
num_planes_03 <- sum(planes$origin %in% c("JFK", "LGA", "EWR"))

# Print the result
kable(num_planes_03)

# Count the number of airplanes from NYC included in the flights table
num_airplanes <- flights %>%
  filter(origin %in% c("JFK", "LGA", "EWR")) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(total = n()) %>%
  arrange(year)

# Print the table using kable
kable(num_airplanes, format = "markdown", caption = "Number of Airplanes from NYC by Year")

```

## Problem 7: Use the `nycflights13` to answer the following questions:

```         
-   Q1: What is the median arrival delay on a month-by-month basis in each airport?
-   Q2: For each airline, plot the median arrival delay for each month and origin airport.

    Q1&Q2: Answer: Both information can be found in the graph as shown below.
```

```{r}

# Data preparation
data(flights)
flights <- select(flights, month, origin, arr_delay)

# Calculate median arrival delay time on a month-by-month basis in each airport
median_delay <- flights %>%
  group_by(month, origin) %>%
  summarise(median_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

# Create the graph
graph <- ggplot(median_delay, aes(x = month, y = median_delay, color = origin)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = median_delay), vjust = -0.5, size = 3) +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Median Arrival Delay (minutes)", color = "Origin") +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(origin)) +
  ggtitle("Median Arrival Delay Time by Month and Origin Airport")

# Print the graph
print(graph)

```

## Problem 8: Let's take a closer look at what carriers service the route to San Francisco International (SFO). Join the `flights` and `airlines` tables and count which airlines flew the most to SFO. Produce a new dataframe, `fly_into_sfo` that contains three variables: the `name` of the airline, e.g., `United Air Lines Inc.` not `UA`, the count (number) of times it flew to SFO, and the `percent` of the trips that that particular airline flew to SFO.

Q8: Answer: As shown in the tables, United Airlines. INC is the most airlines which flew to SFO.

```{r}
# Load the necessary data
data(flights)
data(airlines)

# Join flights and airlines tables and filter for flights to SFO
fly_into_sfo <- flights %>%
  inner_join(airlines, by = "carrier") %>%
  filter(dest == "SFO") %>%
  
  # Group the data by airline name
  group_by(name) %>%
  
  # Calculate the count and percentage of flights to SFO for each airline
  summarise(count = n(), percent = sprintf("%.2f%%", n() / nrow(.) * 100)) %>%
  
  # Arrange the data in descending order of count
  arrange(desc(count))

# Print the resulting dataframe
kable(fly_into_sfo)
```

And here is some bonus ggplot code to plot your dataframe

```         
```

## Problem 9: Let's take a look at cancellations of flights to SFO. We create a new dataframe `cancellations` as follows

\
We can create multiple graphs to show the number of canceled flights per month for each combination of Origin (EWR, JFK, LGA) and Carrier using the following steps. I will also provide the code separately.

1.  Aggregate the number of canceled flights by Origin, Carrier, and month using the **`cancellations`** dataframe.

2.  Create the base of the graph using the **`ggplot()`** function.

3.  Display the number of canceled flights as bar graphs using the **`geom_col()`** function.

4.  Create a grid of graphs based on the combination of Origin and Carrier using the **`facet_grid()`** function.

5.  Set the graph title and axis labels using the **`labs()`** function.

```{r}
# Create the 'cancellations' object with your desired data
cancellations <- flights

# Group cancellations by Origin, Carrier, and month
cancellation_counts <- cancellations %>%
  group_by(origin, carrier, month) %>%
  summarise(cancelled_flights = n())

# Create the graph
ggplot(cancellation_counts, aes(x = month, y = cancelled_flights)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_grid(origin ~ carrier) +
  labs(title = "Cancelled Flights to SFO by Origin and Carrier",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Cancelled Flights")
```

I want you to think how we would organise our data manipulation to create the following plot. No need to write the code, just explain in words how you would go about it.

## Problem 10: On your own -- Hollywood Age Gap

The website https://hollywoodagegap.com is a record of *THE AGE DIFFERENCE IN YEARS BETWEEN MOVIE LOVE INTERESTS*. This is an informational site showing the age gap between movie love interests and the data follows certain rules:

-   The two (or more) actors play actual love interests (not just friends, coworkers, or some other non-romantic type of relationship)
-   The youngest of the two actors is at least 17 years old
-   No animated characters

The age gaps dataset includes "gender" columns, which always contain the values "man" or "woman". These values appear to indicate how the characters in each film identify and some of these values do not match how the actor identifies. We apologize if any characters are misgendered in the data!

The following is a data dictionary of the variables used

| variable            | class     | description                                                                                             |

| release_year        | integer   | Release year                                                                                            |
| director            | character | Director of the film                                                                                    |
| age_difference      | integer   | Age difference between the characters in whole years                                                    |
| couple_number       | integer   | An identifier for the couple in case multiple couples are listed for this film                          |

| actor_1\_birthdate  | date      | The birthdate of the older member of the couple                                                         |
| actor_2\_birthdate  | date      | The birthdate of the younger member of the couple                                                       |

How would you explore this data set? Here are some ideas of tables/ graphs to help you with your analysis

-   How is `age_difference` distributed? What's the 'typical' `age_difference` in movies?

    Answer:

    As shown in the graph as below, The age difference is predominantly concentrated between 0 and 20 in the data, and beyond 20, there is a tendency for the age difference to decrease as it increases.

    The typical age_difference is 8.

-   The `half plus seven\` rule. Large age disparities in relationships carry certain stigmas. One popular rule of thumb is the [half-your-age-plus-seven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships#The_.22half-your-age-plus-seven.22_rule) rule. This rule states you should never date anyone under half your age plus seven, establishing a minimum boundary on whom one can date. In order for a dating relationship to be acceptable under this rule, your partner's age must be:

$$\frac{\text{Your age}}{2} + 7 < \text{Partner Age} < (\text{Your age} - 7) * 2$$ How frequently does this rule apply in this dataset?

Answer: The rule applies to 795 movies.

-   Which movie has the greatest number of love interests?

    Answer: It is Love actually and it has 7 love interests.

-   Which actors/ actresses have the greatest number of love interests in this dataset?

    Answer: The actor who has greatest number of love interests is Keanu Reeves and it has 24.

-   Is the mean/median age difference staying constant over the years (1935 - 2022)?

    Answer: No, mean and median age difference is increasing over the years. Detailes are shown in the table.

-   How frequently does Hollywood depict same-gender love interests?

    Answer: 23

You must be commiting and pushing tour changes to your own Github repo as you go along.

**Please seek out help when you need it,** and remember the [15-minute rule](https://mam2022.netlify.app/syllabus/#the-15-minute-rule){target="_blank"}. You know enough R (and have enough examples of code from class and your readings) to be able to do this. If you get stuck, ask for help from others, post a question on Slack-- and remember that I am here to help too!

> As a true test to yourself, do you understand the code you submitted and are you able to explain it to someone else?

# Rubric

1313: Problem set is 100% completed. Every question was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output. Multiple Github commits. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often.

813: Problem set is 60--80% complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance. Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). A few Github commits.

513: Problem set is less than 60% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often. Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. No Github commits.
